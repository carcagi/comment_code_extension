# Carcargi Comment Generator

This is a Visual Studio Code extension that uses the OpenAI API to automatically generate comments for your code.

## Features

- Generate comments for selected code.
- Use the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 to understand your code and provide relevant comments.

## Installation

1. Install the extension from a generated `.vsix` file.
2. Once installed, you'll need to set the OpenAI API Key in the settings. Open your settings (File > Preferences > Settings) and set the `carcargi-comment-generator.openaiApiKey` to your OpenAI API key.

## Usage

1. Select the code you want to comment.
2. Open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.
3. Type 'Generate Comment' and hit enter.

This will generate a comment for your selected code and replace the code with the commented one.
Keep in mind the token limit might cut long functions or portions of code.
